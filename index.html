      <h3>Interesting facts:</h3>
            <h4>I couldn't just give one interesting factoid so I hereby attach below, 2 videos and 1 link that say a lot about me:</h4>
            <ol><li><p>I love science. And this video is one of my favourite scientific videos. It explains scientific facts in an eloquent way, combining science, with the emotional impact of the consequences of a journey through space.</p>
            <p>This video amazes me in the scope and the possibilities, and ultimately shows the rammifications in the future that we cannot get away from.</p>
            <p>Cool Worlds Youtube Channel is a great educational and entertaining resource. It focuses on space related scientific discoveries, exploration, and the physical principles that govern the universe. The host is Professor David Kipping of Columbia University.</p></li>

              <br></br>
            <li><p>This next video is so heart warming and devastatingly sad at the same time. It is so emotional that it makes me cry every single time I watch it.</p>
            <p>Thankfully there are people like Pastor Lee in the world. However, with the knowledge that he is not long of this world. I am deeply saddened when thinking of who will take in, and take care of the babies after he has gone.</p></li>

              <br></br>
            <li><p>This link below, may be the funniest article I've ever read. Maybe it's the made up physics formula - SETI. Maybe it's the way the victims are mercilessly criticised, in a humourous way. Unfortunately for them, it's been recorded and placed on the internet where it will be forever shared with the rest of the world in perpetuity.</p>
            <p>In any case, let me lighten the mood with this next link</p></li>
            <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cracked.com/blog/the-8-most-violent-falls-ever-survived-youtube">Cracked.com - The 8 Most Violent Falls Ever Survived on YouTube</a>
            <li><p>And if the above wasn't explicitly and literally an interesting fact about me - let me give you this interesting fact:</p>
              <p>25 years ago or there abouts, I did an Introduction to Computing course in UNSW. The first assignment too, was creating a website. HTML3 was the standard and HTML4 was only released during the 1st semester of that year, in April 1998. If I recall, I received a distinction for that course and was disappointed. Now, I'll be satisfied knowing that I shouldn't stress about small matters in life. (as long as I pass).</p>

    <div id="MyInterest" class="tabcontent">

      <h3>My Interests</h3>
      <h4>What is your interest in IT?</h4>
      <p>I am currently in a IT Project Management role, and thoroughly enjoy managing resources and applying myself both high level and low level - when the opportunity arises.</p>
      <p>Deep inside my psyche, I would love to be a great programmer. To be able to create something cohesive, elegant, and have it seen as a benchmark to progresses humanity forward. Whether it be something small but helpful, or groundbreaking, such as general artificial intelligence.</p>
      <p>I would like to be able to create a world in VR. Whether it be to assist in allowing those that cannot explore, to be able to explore a whole new world. Or for others, to provide breath taking adventures.</p>
      <p>I would like to have the opportunity to create tools that can calculate the trajectory to the moon, or mars, or stars. To map the path to the nearest exo planet in Proxima Centauri.</p>
      <p>Or create an artifical intelligence that allows a system to model and analyse chemical interactions to cure cancer.</p>
      <p>In the end, it doesn't matter whether I create something from scratch, or helping to accomplish the common goal in a team.</p>
      <p>What's important for me, is to contribute something to improve humanity in some way.</p>

      <h4>When did your interest in IT start?</h4>
      <p>When I was about growing up, about the age of 8, I was introduced into the world of IT with the Commodore 64 personal computer and a Nintendo entertainment system.
      I used the Commodore 64 for games and I also learnt how to program the Commodore 64 using Basic. Later on, after transcribing an assembler/compiler from a magazine, I used hexadecimal to code simple games like a Zaxxon clone.
      Of course, I used magazines to provide the source code.
      It was this realisation, that showed that the computer could provide a method for humans to create programs to calculate a desired product.</p>
      <p>Later on my family bought a Tandy 1000 - an IBM AT clone.The IBM clone was more business focused and had productive applications. (all be it very simple and unstable.)
      It also had games for entertainment, but it further opened the possibilities and showed the direction that computers were headed:</p>
      <p>More powerful, with each generation. More capable - with unlimited possibilities in the future.</p>

      <h4>Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest? Outline your IT experience (if any).</h4>
      <p>So if there was any person, it would be my father who bought the Commodore 64 and other computers as I grew up. It opened up a world of opportunities to learn, and enjoy as a past time.</p>
      <p>There were several events that sparked my interest in IT. Where it was discovering games, playing games with my siblings, or with friends. Discovering PC magazines and books that allowed me to learn some programming. And some magazines came with cassette tapes, then floppy disks which stored programs, games and applications.</p>
      <p>What is surprising to me now, is that I didn’t think about a job in IT till probably in Year 11 in my Computer Studies course.</p>
      <p>My teacher at that time mentioned that you could get well paid jobs in IT. He mentioned for example, that database administrators can earn $500 an hour. That was in 1994!</p>
      <p>Of course, I am still looking for a job paying that well in IT. But that memory did get me interested in a career in IT.</p>
      <p>I had this romantic (or naïve) idea about being a jet setting IT expert, wearing Armani and globe trotting as an expert IT in First Class.</p>

      <h4>Why did you choose to come to RMIT?</h4>
      <p>I searched several online course options, hosted with different universities. And the RMIT syllabus was the one that was most ideal for me. It had programming units but also Project Management. The Project Managemetn component would aid in what I currently do, and the programming would enable what I could do in the future.
      Additionally, looking at the University worldwide rankings, RMIT was at a reasonable level for Australia. It is well respected. And having spent some time studying in RMIT Melbourne about 25 years ago, I had a good experience there. This helped to solidify my choice of RMIT.</p>

      <h4>What do you expect to learn during your studies?</h4>
      <p>I expect to learn about information technology in a more up to date manner than when I completed by first Introduction to Computing course over 25 years ago.</p>
      <p>I expect to learn from the ground up, and hope to clear any misconceptions I may have, after being in the sector for many years.</p>
      <p>However, I will use my experience and knowledge to question the knowledge being given to me. So I can analyse for myself again, what is false and what is correct.</p>
      <p>I expect to learn about programming and the frameworks within IT in general. Learning in a way that is correct, formalised - with the correct technique and methodologies.</p>
      <p>Specifically of programming, I expect to learn about modern paradigms that weren't around a quarter of a century ago. Such as machine learning, big data, internet of things. Not to forget the low level programming techniques. Up date to date programming languages. Either the latest revision of C, Java, or Python and the latest frameworks. From the basics of formula, syntax, arrays, to the more advanced such as linking libraries, creating polymorphic code and other bleeding edge computational developments.</p>
      <p>I will expect to learn about the project management aspects and how it applies to the information technology space, as well as leading teams, and other management level knowledge.</p>

    <div id="MyJob" class="tabcontent">
      <h3>Preface:</h3>
      <p>My ideal job will have the ability to make key decisions that directly impact, and shape the course of a company.</p>
      <p>Additionally the end product has to be beneficial to people, community, society and ideally humanity at large. Ideally, it will be at the director or executive level.</p>
      <p>The company or product / output cannot damage or otherwise hurt the groups mentioned above directly, or as a result of a bi product of the above.</p>
      <p>Ie. Defence/Arms industry. Main output / product is damaging to the environment or is poisonous to humans or animals, or plants.</p>
      <p>However, if it is a Space and aeronautics venture to drive human exploration / colonisation, then the key directive is for the benefit of humanity and overrides other impacts to the environment.</p>
      <p>Another ideal job would be as the founder of a startup or CEO of a large tech company similar to FAANG.</p>
      <p>If I were to take a step back into reality, and not think I am Elon Musk or Sergey Brin for a minute, my ideal realistic job would be one that:</p>
        <ul><p>•	Allows key decision making</p></ul>
        <ul><p>•	Shape the strategy</p></ul>
        <ul><p>•	Managing people</p></ul>
        <ul><p>•	Benefits from my knowledge, experience and skillset</p></ul>
        <ul><p>•	Company product is benefitting humanity</p></ul>

      <h3>Here is one example of an ideal job for me:</h3>
      <IMG SRC="images/idealjob.png" alt="Ideal Job" title="Ideal Job" width=768px;height="auto">

        <h3>A description (in your own words) of the position, and particularly what makes this position appealing to you.</h3>
<p>The position is a Director of IT.</p>
<p>The high level function is to be responsible for the management of everything in the IT department. It will involve being one of the key drivers of strategy and decision making that impacts the corporation at a senior level. It may involve controlling or directing multiple streams of projects, the schedule, budget, and managing the head count available to the IT department.</p>
<p>It is appealing to me, as it would constitute a promotion (or three) from my current position as a Project Manager. In addition to the management of teams, it would also allow me to extend my responsibilities to decision making and helping shape the core strategic aims.</p>
<p>I like the sections that state I will be responsible for business and relationship management, people development and financial control of the IT budget.</p>
<p>The position has direct impact not only to the staff within the company. But the position would also have a direct impact the patients and their families. Whether it be in the products and services that the company provides.</p>
<p>The company, being a pharmaceutical company produces products that benefit many people directly. This for me would tick the requirement that what I am doing constitutes improving society and humanity in a meaningful way.</p>

<h3>A description (in your own words) of the skills, qualifications and experience required for the position.</h3>
<p>The requirements are described generically, but I would believe that it requires:</p>
<ol><li>Multiple years driving successful large projects and programs.</li>
<li>Documented successes and verifiable inputs that led to the success</li>
<li>Fluent oral and written English language skills. In addition to the business nous required to form a position, and the communication and relationship management skills to get people onboard and working towards a common goal.</li>
<li>It is also to facilitate, inform and negotiate with both internal and external parties to gain approval, to mediate agreements, and largely drive the organisation to benefit by helping guide tasks to success.</li>
<li>Success in managing IT teams and inter-departmental negotiations.</li>
</ol>

<h3>A description (in your own words) of the skills, qualifications and experience you currently have.</h3>
<ol><li>I have a high level of communication and negotiation skills.</li>
<li>I am able to create relationships within teams and within complex matrix like orgnisations.</li>
<li>I am able to think within a strict logical framework and also have a creative and flexible mindset to achieve goals.</li>
<li>I have qualifications in Prince2 Foundation and Practitioner. I have a known project management methodology.</li>
<li>I have over 15 years experience in project management driving projects in multiple industries. As a Project Manager, Project Analyst and other roles within the PMO team.</li>
</ol>

<h3>A plan describing how you will obtain the skills, qualifications and experience required for the position,
building on those you have now. This need not be greatly detailed, (and will probably change significantly
over time anyway), but try to be as specific as you can.</h3>
<ol>
      <li>I will be required to complete a Bachelors Degree in Information Technology.
      <ol type ="a"><li>While I am working full time, I will study part time. I estimate the duration to complete the course to be 5-6 years.</li></ol>
      <li>Following on from this, I will need an MBA to acquire the skillset for the management of people and teams.</li>
      <ol type ="a"><li>While I am working full time, I will study part time. I estimate the duration to complete the course to be 4-5 years.</li></ol>
      <li>I will need to work in a successful environment to earn the 10+ years experience leading Operation/Digital teams.</li>
      <ol type ="a"><li>As mentioned, the job requirement is 10 years experience however, it doesn't hurt to apply for the role before the 10 years. And instead, promote myself by stating that I had over a 15 years worth of experience in a Project Management role, which contributes to some relevant experience in managing a successful portfolio.</li></ol>
</ol>

    <a href="https://www.matrix.edu.au/quiz-whats-your-learning-style/" target="_blank">https://www.matrix.edu.au/quiz-whats-your-learning-style/</a>
    <p>I am a visual learner.</p>

    <br>

    <h3>IQ Test</h3>
    <a href="https://Mensa.org" target="_blank">Mensa.org</a>
    <p>A free online test is available from the website. I completed 30/35 questions in the 25 minute time limit.</p>
    <p>Which resulted in the IQ score of 125. I am devastated. I wanted to get into Mensa.</p>
    <img SRC="images/mensa.png" width="720px" height="auto">
    <br>

    <h3>What do the results of these tests mean for you?</h3>
    <p>I believe the results of these tests show results that may help an individual find an ideal job to suit themselves, or improve their learning strategy.</p>
    <p>For me, I would like to think that the results are simply as only one indicator. Specific to the biases inherent in every test. It is not the end all and be all, of that individual.</p>
    <p>In saying that, one can learn and decide for oneself how accurate the categorisation or label is for us.</p>
    <p>And either use it as an asset - a way to know oneself, and improve your own set of skills, with the strategies recommended.</p>
    <p>Or if you believe it does not indicate your true nature, investigate yourself how your psychology operates and if unique, find a way to work with it and progress from there.</p>
    <p>Knowing this, we can shape the habits we have to make best use of our styles. Whether it is learning, or social interactions, or to help decide what career we have that will best engage us.</p>
    <p>For me the tests show that I am a logical, visual and (semi) intelligent person. I believe I need to be in a career that uses my logic and intelligence, and use my visual thinking style to the best extent I can.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team?</h3>
    <p>I would be more aware of my compulsions and control them better. And use my skillset and traits to its potential.</p>
    <p>This way you can mitigate and minimise any detrimental behaviour and utilise the strengths I have.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>How should you take this into account when forming a team</h3>
    <p>It would be ideal to form a team of individuals with different traits and skillsets, so each have their own areas of expertise and personality traits. Some may be more comfortable in leadership and social situations, such as being extroverted.</p>
    <p> While others can be more introverted but highly skilled in analysis, and problem solving.</p>
    <p>Forming a team with different strengths and capabilities allows each member to shine in different areas.</p>
    <p>Which benefits the team as a whole.</p>

    <div id="MyProject" class="tabcontent">
      <h2>Karma™</h2>
      <img SRC="images/karma.jpeg">
      <h3>Overview:</h3>
      <p>I am creating a platform that will showcase ‘Karma’ ie. The spirit of good will generated by a person's actions.</p>
      <p>It will be public facing and available to people who sign up and become members.</p>
      <p>This online platform will track people’s activities within this platform.</p>
      <p>he activities can include helping people, through an online submission, notice board and acceptance system.</p>
      <p>An example of an activity, may be for socialising with the elderly or helping with giving food for the homeless.</p>
      <p>It will be flexible so activities can anything else that is suggested by the community, as long as it is safe and morally and ethically acceptable.</p>
      <p>The key driver for the platform will be the Karma™ score.</p>
      <p>Members are able to show their Karma score and share it within the Karma platform and other social media platforms.</p>
      <p>This platform will be online, accessible via computer, tablet, mobile and watch.</p>
      <br>
      <h3>Motivation:</h3>
      <p>I believe there is a need in today’s world to allow good deeds to be recognised.</p>
      <p>It should be encouraged, and it should flourish.</p>
      <p>I first came up with this idea about 12 years ago. Since then, it’s been put on the back burner. I have however kept an eye for a similar platform and I have not yet seen a system that offers this type of service.</p>
      <p>This recent article shares my sentiment. The article shows that it is an issue that is recognised in today’s society.</p>
      <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2022-09-18/decline-volunteers-young-old-australians/101446836" target="_blank">Young people aren't volunteering as much. (link)</a>
      <p>Members of our society that are not as social, be they elderly, or not as mobile, be they disabled, should be able to have an opportunity to have a willing and able person to liven up their world.</p>
      <p>And the charities that help feed the homeless, or the less well to do, I believe would gladly accept any help from volunteers.</p>
      <p>1 good deed, deserves another.</p>
      <p>I think of it as the new gig economy but for those that want more than just money.</p>
      <p>They want a fulfilled and happy conscience.</p>
        <br>
<h3>Description:</h3>
<p>Karma will be a social platform where everyday individuals can task, rest and play with the knowledge that they are improving not only their lives, but the lives of the people around them and society in general.</p>
<p>Karma allows volunteering, helping, tasking and enjoying the fruits of your activities in safe environment.</p>
<p>The platform will initially be for volunteering with no money changing hands.</p>
<p>Though eventually it will be able to introduce a system where money can change hands, when both parties agree.</p>
<p>The Karma system will be also eventually be designed to allow trading of goods or services.</p>
<p>In all, this platform will be where everything a member does will contribute to their Karma © score.</p>
<p>It will show how trustworthy a person is. How charitable they are, and the good deeds that they do.</p>
<p>It will have a Karma scoring system where members can share, and be proud of their Karma score.</p>
<p>They can share, and be proud of their achievement and have the admiration of their peers.</p>
<br>
<p>In summary, it will be an online system where activities and/or tasks are listed. And members can join that activity, or complete the task.</p>
<p>The focus of the tasks will be for charitible and good willed activities.</p>
<p>And emphasis will also be placed on the safety of the system and the members.</p>
<br>
<p>Some of the workflow/milestones of the system will be:</p>
<ol><li>Registration of Users</li>
<li>Background check of users.
<li>ID system and security will be a focus. When parties meet, identification will be available with verified name and photos.
<li>If there is any tasks that are around children, a working with children certificate is required.
<li>Karma levels are based on how many times a person has good reviews.
<li>Depending on the activities the User has performed, and the reviews they get, their Karma score is increased.
<li>There are multiple levels of Karma.
<li>There is encouragement to increase Karma as well as diversify activities.
<li>There will be multiple activities that are on offer. For example:</li>
<ol type="a"><li>	Volunteering with elderly / aged care homes.</li>
  <ol type="i"><li>This may include socialising.</li>
              <li>Helping with food preparation.</li>
	             <li>Helping them walk around town etc</li></ol>
  <li>Cleaning up a house.</li></ol>
<li>Some tasks may have a monetary reward. We will let the members set it up.</li>
<li>Some tasks may be based on bartering system.</li>
<li>Some tasks may require like for like activities.</li>
<ol type="a">
    <li>Member A house sits Member B and in exchange Member B house sits for Member A at a later time.</li>
    <li>Or the Member A house sits Member B. Member B house sits Member C. Member C house sits Member A.</li>
</ol>
<li>All tasks earn Karma points. There will be a weighting system on how many Karma points are earned with each activity. This may change over time.</li>
<li>Everything is tracked and if a Member doesn’t receive a good review, their Karma is reduced.</li>
<li>A verification and appeal system is available.</li>
<li>	Accessibility will be available via all modern devices:</li>
<ol type="a">
    <li>Website / Computer</li>
    <li>Mobile phone</li>
    <li>Tablet App</li>
    <li>Smart watch</li>
</ol>
<li>Karma will engage with organisations such as charities and aged care providers, to form partnerships.</li>
<li>Karma will be prominent in local communities and also national, and internationally.</li>
<li>Local councils, communities, social clubs along with sporting clubs will be engaged.</li>
<li>Task vacancies can be perused and accepted.</li>
<li>All events, profiles and Karma scores can be shared amongst all the social platforms.</li>


<h4>Minimum viable product:</h4>
<p>Create a mobile app and backend server system to host the platform.</p>
<p>The mobile app should be available for both Android and Apple. I believe that both platforms should be available even as a MVP. As I believe not allowing both platforms will be detrimental to the success of the platform in the long run.</p>
<p>As people may psychologically be turned off if one platform is favoured over another.</p>
<p>The backend should consist of a cloud provider hosting the application server and database server.</p>
<p>The cloud platform will allow elasticity and scale quicky and easily to accommodate any growth, and especially suited to spike growths. If the platform is promoted in a high exposure way.</p>
<p>Partnerships will be invaluable to the platform, the priority will be to work with private aged care facilities as they may not have as strict a framework, to allow volunteers to engage with the elderly.</p>
<p>Partnerships with charities such as those giving food to the poor would be available too before launch.</p>
<p>Government relationships can be worked at a later date.</p>
<p>The first set of members must be nominated by the orgnisations, and church groups and are invitation only.</p>
<p>Initially background checks are by referral only from an existing member.</p>
<p>Later on, financial, police checks and working with children checks can be provided by Karma.</p>
<p>No cash transactions will be available for the MVP. This is to ease any legislative barriers early on.</p>
<p>Later on, it can be implemented and advertised once the platform becomes viable for the costs to be incurred and legal counsels can be engaged.</p>
<p>Karma scores will still be an integral part of the platform.</p>
<p>And early adopters will be highlighted by a token or avatar as a founding member.</p>


<h3>Tools and Technologies:</h3>
<p>We would use most of the tools and technologies available such as:</p>
<p>A responsive and interactive website. Written in HTML5 and Javascript.</p>
<p>We will have laptop computers for all staff including powerful models for programmers and creative oriented laptops for the designers</p>
<p>Programming languages such as Kotlin, Java, Swift for the mobile apps.</p>
<p>We would of course provide mobile phones to staff members, to use as business function and for app specific testing.</p>
<p>Cloud service providers to host the servers, both application and database.</p>
<p>This would allow very quick and easy scalability, allowing the service to grow quickly and easily.</p>
<p>Programming languages for the back end software include C++, Golang, Java, Python and SQL.</p>
<p>We would use Linux servers for the backend. Including website hosting.</p>
<p>Although open source office applications are avaible, I would still use the MS Office suite for the typical business utilities ie. Excel, Word etc. as most people are comfortable using this software suite.</p>


<h3>Skills required:</h3>
<p>We would need software developers, as most of the initial investment and effort will be creating the software platform.</p>
<p>Multiple software developers are required to create the front end applications for IOS, Android.</p>
<p>Developers for the back end - server side and database management.</p>
<p>We will need server / cloud administrators to manage the infrastructure.</p>
<p>We will need legal specialists to ensure that everything that is done is legal and for contract writing.</p>
<p>We will need marketing specialists to promote the product. As the platform will flourish when many members are participating.</p>
<p>We will need project managers to ensure tasks and milestones are adhered to.</p>
<p>We will need finance staff to manage the money.</p>
<p>We will need administrators to ensure the bills get paid.</p>
<p>We will outsource the payroll.</p>
<p>As we expect the platform to grow, and the staff numbers will grow, we will require HR staff.</p>
<p>We will need testers and penetration specialists to ensure software stability, security and privacy.</p>
<p>We will also need liason/partnership managers to sign up organisations and encourage partnerships with companies and governments.</p>
<p>We will also need a leader, which will be myself to head the organisation.</p>
<br>
<h3>Outcome:</h3>
<p>A better world.</p>
<p>Put Simply, if the venture is successful, it will enable multitude of people to easily help those in need. And not only that, they will help themselves with a clear conscience and leave a lasting legacy of goodness in the world.</p>
<p>Imagine the youth, socialising and learning from the more wise section of the population?</p>
<p>Image the elderly who will have their day lifted from being able to socialise and have the opportunity to teach and also learn from each other.</p>
<p>It will hopefully inspire others to become a better person.</p>
<p>And if it encourages people to volunteer, by removing any hurdles to allow them to do reach out and help.</p>
<p><i>Wouldn't that make the world a better place?</i></p>
